#+TITLE: Gumshoe: a spatial Point movement tracker

* Introduction
Gumshoe is a global minor mode that quietly keeps tabs on your Point movements so you can retrace your steps if you ever need a reminder where you’ve been.

[[./demo.gif]]
(This demonstrates the non-built-in consult-gumshoe command I describe below, because it’s the most visual. I usually just use gumshoe--backtrack-back/forward.)

Gumshoe does not keep track of every move you make, rather, only at increments of some minimum Euclidean distance from the last tracked position, like a leash. It will also automatically log a position if you’ve idled there for a configurable amount of time. This package is very similar to Vim’s jump list, just generalized for Emacs.

* Installation
I just use straight+use-package like so:
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package gumshoe
    :straight (gumshoe :type git
                       :host github
                       :repo "Overdr0ne/gumshoe"
                       :branch "master")
    :config
    ;; The minor mode must be enabled to begin tracking
    (global-gumshoe-mode 1))
#+end_src

* Usage
- Once *global-gumshoe-mode* is enabled, gumshoe will automatically start recording movements into the *gumshoe--log* ringbuffer.
- Use *gumshoe-backtrack-back* and *gumshoe-backtrack-forward* to jump backwards and forwards in the log.
- Minibuffer autocompletion: Consult supports autocompletion of global(non buffer-local) marks. I’ve decided to remove built-in support for consult, because there are many great autocompletion packages out there. This is the one I use though, so here’s how I use it. You may define a consult function for gumshoe like so:
#+begin_src elisp
  (defun consult-gumshoe ()
    (interactive)
    (consult-global-mark (ring-elements gumshoe--log)))
#+end_src
I then just added that to my use-package definition.
- Configure Gumshoe’s euclidean follow distance by customizing the *gumshoe--follow-distance* variable.
- Configure Gumshoe’s idle time by customizing the *gumshoe-idle-time* variable.
- Configure the number of locations logged with the *gumshoe-log-len* variable.
- Horizontal distance is scaled down by a factor of 3 by default, since columns are approximately that much narrower than rows, but you can modify *gumshoe-horizontal-scale* if you want.
- If you use [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]], gumshoe will load *consult-gumshoe* for you. This command allows you to browse the *gumshoe--log* interactively, just like *consult-mark*.
