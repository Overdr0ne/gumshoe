#+TITLE: Gumshoe

* Introduction
Gumshoe quietly keeps tabs on your movements so you can retrace your steps if you ever need a reminder where you’ve been.

(This demonstrates the consult-gumshoe command because it’s the most visual. I usually just use gumshoe--backtrack-back/forward.)

Gumshoe does not keep track of every move you make, rather, only at increments of some minimum Euclidean distance from the last tracked position, like a leash. This package is very similar to Vim’s jump list, just generalized for Emacs.

* Installation
I just use straight+use-package like so:
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package gumshoe
    :straight (gumshoe :type git
                        :host github
                        :repo "Overdr0ne/gumshoe"
                        :branch "master"))
#+end_src

* Usage
- Once installed, gumshoe will automatically start recording movements into the *gumshoe--log* ringbuffer.
- Use *gumshoe-backtrack-back* and *gumshoe-backtrack-forward* to jump backwards and forwards in the log.
- Configure Gumshoe’s euclidean follow distance by customizing the *gumshoe--follow-distance* variable.
- Configure the number of locations logged with the *gumshoe--log-len* variable.
- Horizontal distance is scaled down by a factor of 3 by default, since columns are approximately that much narrower than rows, but you can modify *gumshoe--horizontal-scale* if you want.
- If you use [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]], gumshoe will load *consult-gumshoe* for you. This command allows you to browse the *gumshoe--log* interactively, just like *consult-mark*.
