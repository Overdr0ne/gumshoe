#+title: persp-gumshoe

Perspective.el integration for [[https://github.com/Overdr0ne/gumshoe][gumshoe]].

* Overview

This package extends gumshoe's point movement tracking to include perspective information from [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective.el]]. With persp-gumshoe, you can backtrack through your movement history within specific perspectives, making it easier to navigate complex multi-perspective workflows.

* Installation

** MELPA

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package persp-gumshoe
  :after (gumshoe perspective)
  :config
  (require 'persp-gumshoe))
#+end_src

** straight.el

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package persp-gumshoe
  :straight (persp-gumshoe :type git :host github :repo "Overdr0ne/gumshoe"
                           :files ("extensions/persp-gumshoe/*.el"))
  :after (gumshoe perspective)
  :config
  (require 'persp-gumshoe))
#+end_src

* Dependencies

- Emacs 27.1+
- [[https://github.com/Overdr0ne/gumshoe][gumshoe]] 4.0+
- [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective]] 2.0+

* Usage

Simply require the package after loading gumshoe and perspective:

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'persp-gumshoe)
#+end_src

This will automatically:
- Configure gumshoe to track perspective information
- Add perspective-aware backtracking commands

** Commands

- =gumshoe-persp-backtrack= - Backtrack through entries in the current perspective
- =gumshoe-peruse-in-persp= - Browse entries in the current perspective with completion

* How It Works

persp-gumshoe provides:

1. *persp-context.el* - Defines =context-persp=, a subclass of gumshoe's =context= that includes perspective information
2. *persp-gumshoe.el* - Configures gumshoe to use perspective-aware contexts and provides perspective-scoped commands

When you jump to an entry in a different perspective, persp-gumshoe automatically switches to that perspective before jumping to the location.
