;;; Commentary:
;; Gumshoe is a global minor mode that quietly keep tabs on your Point
;; movements so you can retrace your steps if you ever need a reminder of
;; where youâ€™ve been.

;; Gumshoe logs any movements outside their minimum follow distance.
;; They will also log any position you idle at for a while.
;; You may then use their log to backtrack to previous locations.

;;; Code:

(require 'gumshoe-core)
(require 'gumshoe-persp)
